# About Trivia-Game

This is a Seinfeld trivia web application that utilizes JavaScript on the front end. There is a timer that counts down during the current question. If time expires the next question is automatically displayed after a gif that denotes that time has run out. Try your hand at answersing all of the questions correctly! I built this game modularly so I could easily expand it from the current collection of five questions.

## Technologies

    JavaScript (each question is an object in an array)
    HTML
    CSS
    jQuery (jQuery is used to display many elements in the DOM)
